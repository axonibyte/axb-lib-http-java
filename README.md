# Axonibyte Java Library Suite - RESTful API

Copyright (c) 2023 Axonibyte Innovations, LLC. All rights reserved.

This Java library makes it easier to establish RESTful API workflows. It uses an
underlying microframework to perform most of the work, but many frameworks and
microframeworks do a poor job of making it manageable to support a bunch of
endpoints in an organized fashion. In addition, many microframeworks do a poor
job of allowing for custom authentication workflows. This wrapper makes it a
little easier to implement APIs in bulk.
